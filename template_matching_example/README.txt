to run demo use this command:

python ./object_finder.py

Notes:

-the other stuff is the toy examples. May be buggy, was messing with them.
-To read the output of object_finder.py, left image is the quality of matches.
brighter = better match
-Currently each search for object takes ~.5 s, can still heavily improve it
by not searching whole image. On todo list
